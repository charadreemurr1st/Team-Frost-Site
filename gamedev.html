                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE... two games made by my favorite creator Toby Fox. He helped me through some tough times, with all his silly works. His games were awesome to be able to play through, and I'd give anything to play them fresh through again... But I have something in store for you. Just wait a little longer, my friend. - DeltaNerd !</p>

                <p>When not coding, I can be found overthinking the lore of my own game, arguing with teammates about whether a certain mechanic is "too quirky" (it's not), and occasionally staring at my screen wondering why my compiler decided to betray me at 3 AM.</p>

                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> I have actually gotten to travel the world a bit! I hope I get to go to Tokyo in the next two years or so.</p>

                <p><strong>Favorite Food:</strong> Cold pizza and regret.</p>

                <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong> <em>"Skin's sure weird!"</em> - Vee Noceda, The Owl House</p>

                <h2>PHILOSOPHY</h2>
                <p>In game development, it's not just about making something that works—it's about making something that feels right. Every pixel, every sound, every line of dialogue matters. We believe in respecting the player's time and emotions.</p>
                <p>That's why we put determination into everything we create.</p>
