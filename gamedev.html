                <p>Meet the brilliant mind behind Team Frost's core vision and architecture.</p>

                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>Our lead developer is a passionate creator who believes that games should tell stories and touch hearts. With years of experience in game development, they've spent countless hours perfecting the art of pixels, code, and emotion.</p>
                
                <p>When not coding, they can be found overthinking the lore of their own game, arguing with teammates about whether a certain mechanic is "too quirky" (it's not), and occasionally staring at their screen wondering why their compiler decided to betray them at 3 AM.</p>

                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> They once spent 6 hours debugging a bug that turned out to be a missing semicolon. They're still not over it.</p>

                <p><strong>Secret Hobby:</strong> Makes incredibly detailed spreadsheets about game balance that nobody asked for.</p>

                <p><strong>Favorite Food While Coding:</strong> Cold pizza and regret.</p>

                <h2>PHILOSOPHY</h2>
                <p>In game development, it's not just about making something that works—it's about making something that feels right. Every pixel, every sound, every line of dialogue matters. We believe in respecting the player's time and emotions.</p>
                <p>That's why we put determination into everything we create.</p>
