                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE... two games made by my favorite creator Toby Fox. He helped me through some tough times, with all his silly works. His games were awesome to be able to play through, and I'd give anything to play them fresh through again... But I have something in store for you. Just wait a little longer, my friend. - DeltaNerd !</p>

                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> I have actually gotten to travel the world a bit! I hope I get to go to Tokyo in the next two years or so.</p>

                <p><strong>Favorite Food:</strong> Baked Mac n' Cheese.</p>

                <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong> <em>"Skin's sure weird!"</em> - Vee Noceda, The Owl House</p>

With A Mindset Like That, I Am Quite Sorry, But What You Find Nothing Of Interest Without Looking For Something... Unconventional.  Unless Of Course...
